    "description": "This is a proof of concept e-commerce site built with Next.js and TypeScript. The styling is done using Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI components. The site features a product listing page (PLP), product detail page (PDP), and a shopping cart with saved cart functionality. State management is handled using Mobx. Feel free to explore the site and check out the code on my GitHub profile. This project is a work in progress, and there are several features and improvements planned for the future.",
